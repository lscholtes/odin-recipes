    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
        and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), 
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
